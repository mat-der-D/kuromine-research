# Dead Ends

## Congruence Arithmetic (modular sieving)

**Status:** Fundamentally limited. Do not invest further effort in this direction alone.

**What was achieved:** Theorem 5 established that any solution with $x \geq 6$, $y \geq 2$ must satisfy $x \equiv 5 \pmod{332640}$ and $y \equiv -3 \pmod{166320}$. This required combining cubic residue conditions modulo 30+ primes.

**Why it cannot go further:** The phantom rational solution $(5, -3, 10/3)$ survives modulo any $m$ with $\gcd(m, 3) = 1$, because $3^{-1}$ exists in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. The only escape is to use moduli that are powers of 3. But 37 is a cubic residue mod $3^n$ for all $n$ (proved by induction), so even this avenue is closed.

**Conclusion:** Pure congruence sieving cannot prove there are no further solutions. A fundamentally different technique is required.
